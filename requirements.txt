# ML-KEM-512 Implementation Requirements
# Educational post-quantum cryptography implementation
# Python 3.8+

# No external cryptographic libraries required!
# Uses Python standard library only for educational transparency

# Optional: For testing and development
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0

# Note: This implementation intentionally uses only Python standard library:
# - hashlib (SHA3-256)
# - secrets (cryptographically secure randomness)
# - typing (type hints)
#
# No external dependencies for core functionality!
